user1 adds user2 by username

look for user with username and adds that users(user2) info (user id) to user1 
we add to user2 user1's id and a 1 to friendrequest

user2 shall get a notice and have to accept the friendrequest 

if user2 accepts we make the friendrequest from 1 to 0 

if user 2 declines 
we remove user2's info in user1 and remove user1s info in user2

the above will happen if any user removes the other user
